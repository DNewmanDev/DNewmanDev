## üõ† Technologies Demonstrated

**Languages:** Go, Python, C#, C coming soon
**Databases:** PostgreSQL with type-safe queries (sqlc)  
**Frameworks:** Pygame, .NET 9.0  
**Architecture Patterns:** CLI command patterns, HTTP server design, object-oriented programming  
**Tools:** Git, unit testing, database migrations, dependency management

## üèó Technical Highlights

- **Database Integration**: PostgreSQL with generated type-safe queries using sqlc
- **Concurrent Programming**: Goroutines for RSS feed processing and HTTP request handling  
- **API Design**: RESTful endpoints with proper HTTP status codes and content types
- **Testing**: Comprehensive unit test suites with Python unittest framework
- **CLI Design**: Command-pattern architecture with middleware and user authentication
- **Game Architecture**: Physics-based collision detection and real-time rendering
- **Caching**: Custom HTTP client implementations with time-based cache invalidation

## üìã Quick Start

Each project includes its own documentation and can be run independently:

```bash
# Go projects
cd chirpy && go run .
cd gator && go run . register <username>
cd pokedex && go run .

# Python projects  
cd asteroids && python3 main.py
cd static_site_generator && python3 src/main.py

# C# projects
cd DNGlobalKitchenManual/DNGKM && dotnet run
```
